# Arma3-Vic-Spawner

Current Version: V1.0

This is to track my vehicle spawner I have created for Arma 3

When placed into your mission file, you must either place the files in the root folder or make sure any references contain the folder name
IE
Spawner/openMenu.sqf

You must also add

#include "defines.hpp"
#include "control.hpp"

to the top of your description.ext, adding the folder name if placed in a folder

todo

Figure out how to create a array of 'pads', and populate the spawn pad using that for more dynamic use
